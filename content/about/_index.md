# Hi, I'm Sandra Tang

I'm a Computer Science major at Cornell University (Class of 2027) passionate about full stack development! 

## What I Work On

- **Backend Development**: I’ve built backend services using Flask and Docker, and deployed full-stack apps on Google Cloud.
- **Embedded Systems & Imaging**: On the Cornell Unmanned Air Systems team, I develop Rust- and Python-based systems for real-time aerial image processing.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: I’ve trained a ViViT model to predict mouse brain activity from video stimuli using PyTorch and HuggingFace.
- **Web Development**: I’ve created and maintained a school newspaper site using SQL, JavaScript, and Azure; and contributed to React/Node.js full-stack projects on Cornell’s Engineering World Health team.
